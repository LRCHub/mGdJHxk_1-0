the toxin's american made, weapons-class grade
sludge for migrants
dioxin , the chemical sunset,
the number one subset
of all
I know what the Senator wants what the Senator
wants is a Blowjob ×2
Panic in the Antechamber, motion to impeach
Cattle prod the working classes,
there's some things
you cant teach..
cause were fading fast, like a stone
come fading back into the picture you own
Little Nicky Nicky Nicky
Down on Ocean Beach he's a strumming
He used to carry his guitar around his back
And we'd just walk around and look for gigs to
illuminate
Smoking weed in our truck, the Cops Pulled up,
how could they not know???
We were so so so so invisible
Heavy Heavy Heavy heavy smelter--
Is it funny enough??
The serious business is void and null
My duty to the Republique is
to use double speak
because the Halo's off
I know what the Senator wants what the Senator
wants is a Blow job
I know what everyone wants
what everyone wants is
a Blow job
Baby steps of Everest, so much trash to burn
We will stick it where the sun don't shine,
as the world turns...
You star fading fast, like a stone
COme fading back into the picture own
